Vampytest is a testing framework that allows you, but is not limited to write relative import based tests.

> Note that the framework currently is in alpha stage. It can run tests but many features might be missing.

Here are several advantages why you would want them:

- **Simplicity and ease of use**

    Relative import based tests simplify the process of writing and executing tests.
    Relative imports provide a straightforward and intuitive way to import and utilize testing functionalities without
    the need for complex configuration or setup.
    Developers can quickly get started with writing tests and running them, making the testing process more accessible
    and efficient.

- **Seamless integration with codebase**

    By using relative imports the testing framework seamlessly integrates with the codebase being tested.
    It allows the developers to import and test modules or components in a manner that reflects the same import
    structure used in the actual code. This integration enhances readability and maintainability.

- **Encourages modular and isolated testing**

    Relative import based testing promotes modular and isolated testing practices.
    It encouraging the testing of individual units in isolation.
    This isolation makes it easier to pinpoint issues, debug problems, and maintain the codebase.
    It also supports the principles of unit testing, where individual units of code are tested independently for their
    expected behavior.

- **Enhanced collaboration and teamwork**

    Relative import based testing facilitate collaboration among team members.
    By utilizing the same import structure as the codebase, it allows multiple developers to work on tests concurrently
    without conflicts. It makes coordinating testing efforts easier within a team.

- **Easy test refactoring**

    When refactoring or restructuring the codebase, relative import based testing can make it easier to refactor tests
    as well.
    Since the test code closely follows the structure of the codebase, the required changes in test imports are often
    straightforward, resulting in less effort and potential errors during refactoring.

- **Ease of migration and adoption**

    If a codebase already follows a relative import structure, using a testing framework that supports them too
    simplifies the adoption and integration of testing practices.
    Developers can directly use relative imports in their test code, resulting in a smoother transition to the
    testing framework.
